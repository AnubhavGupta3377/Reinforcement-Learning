### Overview
This Repository contains my notes from the course "Introduction to Reinforcement Learning" taught by David Silver at DeepMind.
I have also implemented some of the algorithms along the way.
- Lecture notes are based on one lecture of the online course plus one or more chapters from Sutton and Barto.

### Notes Details
#### Lecture-1
- David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course Lecture-1
- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Chapter 1 

### Implementations Details
For implementing and testing the algorithms, I have used Google Colab, as RL algorithms are typically computationally expensive.
#### openai_gym_tutorial
- Notebook to set up the Gym environment (Resource: https://gym.openai.com/docs/)
