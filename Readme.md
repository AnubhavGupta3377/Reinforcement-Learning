### Overview
This Repository contains my notes from the course **"Introduction to Reinforcement Learning"** taught by David Silver at DeepMind. I have also implemented some of the algorithms along the way.<br/>
Lecture notes are based on one lecture of the online course plus one or more chapters from Sutton and Barto.

### Resources
**Online Course:** [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)<br/>
**Textbook:** [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)

### Notes Details
#### Lecture-1
- This set of notes discusses the problem of Reinforcement Learning and how it differs from other Machine Learning categories such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
- We also describe some of the terminology used in RL, such as **environment, agent, reward, value, model**.
- Then a brief discussion on exploration-exploitation tradeoff is provided.
- This secion of notes is based on
1) Lecture-1 of the Course
2) Book Chapter 1: The Reinforcement Learning Problem 

### Implementations Details
For implementing and testing the algorithms, I have used Google Colab, as RL algorithms are typically computationally expensive.
#### openai_gym_tutorial
- Notebook to set up the Gym environment (Resource: https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

**NOTE: This is a work in progress. This repo will updated soon.**
