### Overview
This Repository contains my notes from the course **"Introduction to Reinforcement Learning"** taught by David Silver at DeepMind. I have also implemented some of the algorithms along the way.<br/>
Lecture notes are based on one lecture of the online course plus one or more chapters from Sutton and Barto.

### Resources
**Online Course:** [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)<br/>
**Textbook:** [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
