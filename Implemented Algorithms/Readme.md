### Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Implementations
Implementations of common RL algorithms discussed in Sutton and Barto. All the algorithms were implemented and tested on Google Colab.

Each directory contains implementations one or more sets of algorithms based on Sutton (except for "openai_gym_tutorial").

#### openai_gym_tutorial
- Notebook to set up the Gym environment (Resource: https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

#### Dynamic Programming
- Implementation of following algorithms on Small Gridworld example
  - Policy evaluation
  - Policy improvement and policy iteration
  - Value iteration
- An implementation of Markov Decision Process for Small Gridworld is also provided.
- The results of the implementations match exactly with those discussed in the book **Sutton and Barto**
